# Comic Catcher

No famous act is safe with this eagle-eyed Lambda on the prowl.

## What it do

- Runs every 5 minutes
- Checks for comics (looking at you James Acaster) mentioned in small gigs, e.g. The Bill Murray/ Secret Comedy Club
- If someone decent is found, we get a text message with the website url to check/ buy tickets
